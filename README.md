UFINCH
======

UFINCH code from ..\MLCode\v01a directory 
UFINCH is a MATLAB-based application for the development of Unit Flows In Networks of CHannels
defined by the NHDPlus v.2 geospatial data frame.  In this version of UFINCH, daily flows from
a streamgage on the downstream most flowline is discretized to 15-min intervals and converted
to water yields by dividing by drainage area at the streamgage.  The resulting yields are applied
to upstream catchments with a lead time indicated by the average velocity and flowline length
leading to the corresponding catchment.
